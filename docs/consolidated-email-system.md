### **Onboarding Completion**

The welcome email is sent in the `completeOnboarding()` function:

```typescript
// Send welcome email after onboarding completion
try {
  // Get plan features based on subscription status
  const getPlanFeatures = (planType: string) => {
    // Dynamic feature list based on plan
  };

  // Get next steps based on setup status
  const getNextSteps = (
    hasStripeConnect: boolean,
    stripeConnectEnabled: boolean
  ) => {
    // Personalized next steps
  };

  await sendWelcomeToDineEasyEmail(user.email!, {
    restaurantName: restaurant.name,
    customerName: user.user_metadata?.full_name || restaurant.name,
    plan: plan,
    interval: interval,
    trialEndDate: trialEndDate,
    hasStripeConnect: !!restaurant.stripe_account_id,
    stripeConnectEnabled: restaurant.stripe_account_enabled || false,
    features: getPlanFeatures(plan),
    nextSteps: getNextSteps(
      !!restaurant.stripe_account_id,
      restaurant.stripe_account_enabled || false
    ),
  });
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error("Error sending welcome email:", emailError);
  // Don't fail onboarding if email fails
