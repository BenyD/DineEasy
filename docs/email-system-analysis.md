```

### **3. Get Restaurant Details (Name Only)**

  .from("restaurants")
  .select("name")
  .eq("id", restaurantId)
  .single();
```

### **4. Send Email to Stripe Customer**

});
```

```

#### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**

const sendEmailWithRetry = async (
  emailFunction: Function,
  data: any,
  maxRetries = 3
) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await emailFunction(data);
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * (i + 1)));
    }
  }
};
```

#### **3. Email Preference Management**

```typescript
