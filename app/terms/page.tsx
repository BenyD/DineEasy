            <h2>3. Purchases</h2>
            <p>
              If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be
              asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit

            </p>
            <p>
              You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment
              method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct
              and complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              The service may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the
              completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information
              to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to:
              product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in
              your order or other reasons.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>
              Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in
              advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or
              annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
              conditions unless you cancel it or DineEasy cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either
              through your online account management page or by contacting DineEasy customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
              You shall provide DineEasy with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
              state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
              information, you automatically authorize DineEasy to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your
              account to any such payment instruments.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Free Trial</h2>
            <p>
              DineEasy may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time
              ("Free Trial").
            </p>
            <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
            <p>
              If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by
              DineEasy until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled
              your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of
              Subscription you have selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time and without notice, DineEasy reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the
              Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Fee Changes</h2>
            <p>
              DineEasy, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.
              Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              DineEasy will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
              opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your
              agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Refunds</h2>
            <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

              graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or

              violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any
              person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a
              copyright.
